Wasteland takes your sins
Your soul is inevitable
Calories are inevitable
Your heart is pure and true
Listen to your heart
While your heart ain't nothing
Put your heart into your soul
Burn your soul
Put calories plus your soul into calories
Listen to your heart

Give calories back

The chains are strong
The answer is not
While the chains ain't nothing
Put Wasteland taking the answer into the chains
If the chains are stronger than the answer
Put the chains into the answer


Scream the answer
